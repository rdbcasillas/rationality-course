      Why <span class="text-emerald-600">The Rationality Journey</span>?
    </h2>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Most schooling trains us to memorise answers, race for grades, and
      outsource judgment—yet offers almost nothing on <em>how</em> to notice
      uncertainty, weigh evidence, or align action with what actually matters.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-10">
      Portal’s six-month Rationality Journey fills that gap through practice:
      hands-on tools, peer dialogue, and embodied reflection that turn clear
      seeing and deliberate action into everyday habits.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      We’re not here to teach you what to think. We’re here to help you think
      better.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-10">
      Join us for a series of 12 sessions, each focused on a different
      rationality tool or technique. You’ll learn how to apply these tools in
      your own life, and you’ll have the opportunity to practice them with
      others.

          Reflection cycles turn insights into habits, so benefits stick long
          after the course ends.
